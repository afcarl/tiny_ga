# Tiny Genetic Algorithm in Python

A minimalistic program implementing a genetic algorithm with the following attributes:

1. The genome is a bitstring (i.e., {0,1}*)
2. The fitness is "maxone" â€” number of 1s in an individual genome
3. Tournament selection
4. Single-point crossover
5. Bitwise flip mutation
